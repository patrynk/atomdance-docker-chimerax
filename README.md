atomdance-docker
================
ver. 1.0-beta

Dockerfile and build for containerized execution of gbabbitt/ATOMDANCE-comparative-protein-dynamics Molecular Dynamics software suite.
ATOMDANCE package source is available here: \
https://github.com/gbabbitt/ATOMDANCE-comparative-protein-dynamics

How to use this repository
==========================
1) Confirm you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) installed.

2) Determine a path on your host machine that you would like to interact with the docker image for passing analyses to and retrieving data from. This is denoted in Step 4 below as /PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY and will be mapped in the docker container as /data. This directory must exist and be writable by the image. Sample instructions for enabling this as follows:
```bash
mkdir /PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY && chmod -R 766 /PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY
```

3) Download UCSF ChimeraX and deposit the ucsf-chimerax_1.6.1ubuntu22.04_amd64.deb file in the empty chimerax/ directory included with the repository. This is how atomdance-docker will install UCSF ChimeraX.
[UCSF-ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html)

4) Set up and run this image locally:
```bash
# 1) Clone this repository and its submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/patrynk/atomdance-docker.git
# 2) Build the image. This will take a WHILE. 
cd atomdance-docker
sudo su
docker-compose build
# 3) Deploy the image and follow the on-screen GUI. Make sure you are root user each time you execute this (i.e. sudo su)
docker-compose run -u atomuser -v /PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY:/data atomdance start
```

5) To run an analysis, copy your chosen MD files to /PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY you specified before, and after running the 'docker-compose run' command specified in step 4, substep 3, specify the paths to the files in the ATOMDANCE UI but replacing /PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY with /data.
For example, the files \
/PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY/example.prmtop \
/PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY/example.pdb \
/PATH/TO/SHARED/DIRECTORY/example.nc \
\
would become \
\
example.prmtop \
example.pdb \
example.nc

Known issues:
- Sometimes CPPTraj hangs with dead processes. Re-starting the analysis will fix this.
- CHOREOGRAPH 2.0 dependency penguoin does not play nicely with ChimeraX python3.9 installation, working on a venv or other fix for this. 
- ChimeraX visualization functionality not yet working within docker image.
